Hello, World! My name is Alex.

I'm a logistical engineer and enthusiastic programmer in my daily life.

Currently, I'm fulltime employed, but I'm open for any collaborating in a free time.

My interests includes web performance (backend), databases and data analysis.

Now I'm focused on improving my code quality.

I am open to considering both commercial and open-source projects.
